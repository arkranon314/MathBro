One apple of Bob plus one apple of Alice equals two apples. That is: 1 (Bob\u0027s apple) + 1 (Alice\u0027s apple) \u003d 2 (apples in the basket). So addition is just counting all the numbers that exist in the sum. For example, 3 + 4 \u003d 7 and 11 + 5 \u003d 16. Is it clear? :) Then go practice!"
