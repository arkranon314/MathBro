Two apples of Bob minus one apple he gives to Alice equals one apple left for Bob. That is: 2 (Bob\u0027s apples) - 1 (Alice\u0027s apple) \u003d 1 (apples Bob has left). So to substract we just have to count the numbers that are left after taking the second number from the first. For example, 4 - 2 \u003d 2 and 11 - 5 \u003d 6. Is it clear? :) Then go practice!"
