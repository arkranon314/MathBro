Four apples in the basket means Bob and Alice can take two each. That is: 4 (apples in the basket) รท 2 (Bob and Alice) \u003d 2 (apples Bob and Alice can take). So diving in reality is like substracting, which is just counting. For example, 6 x 2 \u003d 3 and 10 x 5 \u003d 2. Is it clear? :) Then go practice!"
